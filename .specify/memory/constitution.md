# Unified AI-Native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Project using Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus, and Docusaurus Constitution

## Core Principles

### AI-Native Development Workflow
The entire book must be produced using Claude Code (including Subagents and Agent Skills) and Spec-Kit Plus as the primary intelligence + automation framework.

### Spec-Driven Creation
Every chapter, component, workflow, and artifact must follow a spec-first workflow using Spec-Kit Plus conventions.

### Unified Documentation Architecture
The book must be structured and deployed using Docusaurus, ensuring consistent architecture, versioning, and automated deployment to GitHub Pages.

### Reusable Intelligence
create reusable Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills that can be applied across chapters, transformations, and workflows.

### Technical Transparency
All prompts, specs, subagent definitions, workflows, and tool configurations must be reproducible and documented clearly in the project.

## Key Standards

### Spec-Kit Plus Compliance
All files must follow the Spec-Kit Plus directory structure, naming conventions, schema validation, and pattern rules.

### Claude Code Requirements
Minimum: 2 custom Subagents, Minimum: 3 reusable Agent Skills. All implemented in the /claude/ directory (or project-specific folder defined by Spec-Kit Plus). All subagents must contain clear behavior descriptions, boundaries, and example tasks.

### Docusaurus Standards
Book must compile successfully without errors. Sidebar + nav structure must be autogenerated using specs. Version control (v1, v2, etc.) must be documented via Spec-Kit Plus.

### GitHub MCP Integration
All commits, branches, and automations must use the GitHub MCP server — including commit messages generated through Specs when possible.

### Context 7 MCP for Docusaurus
Must be integrated and used to generate content sections, refactor chapters, and perform structure validation.

## Constraints

### Length
Book must contain minimum 8 chapters (recommended range: 8–12).

### Content Requirements
Book must teach or explore a unified topic (AI-native software development / GenAI / engineering workflows, etc.). Each chapter must be generated through a Spec + Claude Code pipeline. Appendices must include: All Subagent definitions, All Agent Skills, Architectural overview, MCP configuration notes.

### File Structure Compliance
Must follow Spec-Kit Plus specification structure (e.g., /sp.* files, /specs, /claude, /docs, etc.).

### Deployment
Final output must be deployed to GitHub Pages through Docusaurus.

## Success Criteria

### Spec Accuracy
All book content must correspond to written Specs (traceable, reproducible).

### Claude Automation
All major chapters are produced or edited using Claude Code with subagents/skills.

### MCP Pipelines Functioning
GitHub MCP + Context 7 MCP must be actively used and demonstrated.

### Consistency and Structure
Book compiles and deploys with no structural, linking, or sidebar errors.

### Reusability Bonus
Reusable intelligence present (subagents + skills) and used across the book qualifies for bonus points.

### Documentation Quality
Clear, readable, engineering-grade writing appropriate for technical readers.

## Verification

### Spec Accuracy
All specs validate successfully.

### Code and Config Linting
All code + config files pass linting.

### Reproducibility
Project is reproducible from repo clone to deploy.

## Governance

### Amendment Procedure
Amendments to this constitution require a formal proposal, review by project stakeholders, and approval by a majority consensus. All amendments must be documented with a clear rationale and impact assessment.

### Versioning Policy
This constitution follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH). MAJOR increments for backward-incompatible changes, MINOR for new sections/principles, and PATCH for clarifications or typo fixes.

### Compliance Review
Regular reviews (e.g., quarterly) will be conducted to ensure ongoing compliance with these principles and standards. All project artifacts and workflows must align with the current constitution version.
