# Welcome to Embodied Intelligence: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This book serves as a comprehensive guide to the exciting and rapidly evolving field of **Embodied Intelligence**, focusing specifically on **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics**. Our objective is to provide detailed, chapter-level specifications that are not only academically rigorous but also practically applicable.

## Who Is This Book For?

This book is designed for:

-   **Graduate/Advanced Undergraduate AI and Robotics Students**: Those seeking a deep dive into the theoretical and practical aspects of embodied intelligence.
-   **Instructors**: Educators looking for a structured curriculum and hands-on exercises to teach advanced AI and robotics concepts.
-   **Hackathon Participants**: Innovators and developers keen on building intelligent robotic systems using modern tools and frameworks.

## What You Will Learn

Through four core modules, you will explore the essential components and advanced techniques required to develop and understand physical AI and humanoid robotics:

1.  **The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Delve into the fundamental middleware that enables robots to communicate and function.
2.  **The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Learn to create and simulate virtual replicas of robots and their environments for safe and efficient development.
3.  **The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**: Discover advanced perception, navigation, and learning methodologies powered by NVIDIA's cutting-edge platforms.
4.  **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Explore the convergence of large language models (LLMs) with robotics, enabling intuitive voice-to-action and cognitive planning.

## Our Approach: AI-Native & Spec-Driven

This book project itself is a demonstration of AI-native development. It is produced using **Claude Code** (including Subagents and Agent Skills) and **Spec-Kit Plus** as the primary intelligence and automation framework. Every chapter, component, and workflow follows a spec-first methodology, ensuring technical transparency and reproducibility.

We aim to provide a unified documentation architecture, structured and deployed using **Docusaurus**, guaranteeing consistency, versioning, and automated deployment. You will find that all prompts, specifications, subagent definitions, workflows, and tool configurations are clearly documented to allow for complete reproducibility.

Join us on this journey to explore the future of intelligent machines and their physical interaction with the world. Let's build the next generation of humanoid robotics together!
