Unified AI-Native Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Project using Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus, and Docusaurus

Core Principles:

AI-Native Development Workflow
The entire book must be produced using Claude Code (including Subagents ude/ directory (or project-specific folder defined by Spec-Kit Plus)

All subagents must contain clear behavior descriptions, and Agent Skills) and Spec-Kit Plus as the primary intelligence + automation framework.

Spec-Driven Creation
Every chapter, component, workflow, and artifact must follow a spec-first workflow using Spec-Kit Plus conventions.

Unified Documentation Architecture
The book must be structured and deployed using Docusaurus, ensuring consistent architecture, versioning, and automated deployment to GitHub Pages.

Reusable Intelligence
Participants are expected to create reusable Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills that can be applied across chapters, transformations, and workflows.

Technical Transparency
All prompts, specs, subagent definitions, workflows, and tool configurations must be reproducible and documented clearly in the project.

Key Standards:

Spec-Kit Plus Compliance
All files must follow the Spec-Kit Plus directory structure, naming conventions, schema validation, and pattern rules.

Claude Code Requirements

Minimum: 2 custom Subagents

Minimum: 3 reusable Agent Skills

All implemented in the /claboundaries, and example tasks.

Docusaurus Standards

Book must compile successfully without errors.

Sidebar + nav structure must be autogenerated using specs.

Version control (v1, v2, etc.) must be documented via Spec-Kit Plus.

GitHub MCP Integration
All commits, branches, and automations must use the GitHub MCP server — including commit messages generated through Specs when possible.

Context 7 MCP for Docusaurus
Must be integrated and used to generate content sections, refactor chapters, and perform structure validation.
Constraints:

Length:
Book must contain minimum 8 chapters (recommended range: 8–12).

Content Requirements:

Book must teach or explore a unified topic (AI-native software development / GenAI / engineering workflows, etc.)

Each chapter must be generated through a Spec + Claude Code pipeline.

Appendices must include:

All Subagent definitions

All Agent Skills

Architectural overview

MCP configuration notes

File Structure Compliance:
Must follow Spec-Kit Plus specification structure (e.g., /sp.* files, /specs, /claude, /docs, etc.)

Deployment:
Final output must be deployed to GitHub Pages through Docusaurus.

Success Criteria:

Spec Accuracy
All book content must correspond to written Specs (traceable, reproducible).

Claude Automation
All major chapters are produced or edited using Claude Code with subagents/skills.

MCP Pipelines Functioning
GitHub MCP + Context 7 MCP must be actively used and demonstrated.

Consistency and Structure
Book compiles and deploys with no structural, linking, or sidebar errors.

Reusability Bonus
Reusable intelligence present (subagents + skills) and used across the book qualifies for bonus points.

Documentation Quality
Clear, readable, engineering-grade writing appropriate for technical readers.

Verification:

All specs validate successfully

All code + config files pass linting

Project is reproducible from repo clone to deploy'''

## Response snapshot

The project constitution has been updated to version 0.1.0. This is a minor version bump due to the addition of new principles, standards, constraints, success criteria, and verification sections. Please manually review the following templates and documentation files to ensure they align with the updated constitution: .specify/templates/plan-template.md, .specify/templates/spec-template.md, .specify/templates/tasks-template.md, .specify/templates/commands/sp.constitution.md, README.md, docs/quickstart.md. Suggested commit message: docs: amend constitution to v0.1.0 (initial principles, standards, and governance added)

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Constitution updated with project principles, standards, constraints, and success criteria.
- 🧪 Tests: (None)
- 📁 Files: .specify/memory/constitution.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: (None)
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully updated the constitution based on user input, and provided a sync impact report and manual follow-up list.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` script not found, fallback to agent-native tool.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure `create-phr.sh` script path is correct or make it available.
