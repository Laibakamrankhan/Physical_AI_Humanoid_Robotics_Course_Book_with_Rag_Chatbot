## Response snapshot

I have completed the initial planning phase (Phase 0) for the "Embodied Intelligence: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" book project.\n\n- **Feature Branch**: `1-physical-ai-robotics`\n- **Implementation Plan File**: `specs/1-physical-ai-robotics/plan.md`\n- **Generated Research Plan**: `specs/1-physical-ai-robotics/research.md`\n\nThe plan and initial research outline are now available. The next step would typically involve Phase 1: Design & Contracts, but as per the `/sp.plan` command instructions, I am stopping here to report the current status.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Initial implementation plan and research outline created.
- 🧪 Tests: (None)
- 📁 Files: specs/1-physical-ai-robotics/plan.md, specs/1-physical-ai-robotics/research.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with `/sp.plan` for Phase 1 (Design & Contracts).
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully generated plan and research artifacts. Manually handled script execution due to `pwsh` unavailability, ensuring all required files were created and filled as per the template and instructions. Report explicitly states command ends here.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `pwsh` not found; required manual execution of steps.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Incorporate an agent-native method for `setup-plan` that doesn't rely on PowerShell or ensure `pwsh` is available.
