# Design Specification: Embodied Intelligence: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Book

**Branch**: `1-physical-ai-robotics` | **Date**: 2025-12-04 | **Spec**: [specs/1-physical-ai-robotics/spec.md](specs/1-physical-ai-robotics/spec.md)
**Plan**: [specs/1-physical-ai-robotics/plan.md](specs/1-physical-ai-robotics/plan.md)

## Summary

This design specification details the architectural and content blueprint for the "Embodied Intelligence: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics" book. It translates the high-level requirements from the feature specification into a structured, executable plan for content generation across four core modules, ensuring alignment with Docusaurus for deployment and Spec-Kit Plus for automation.

## Unifying Narrative & Progression (Weeks 1–13 Alignment)

The book will adopt a progressive learning curve, ideally aligning with a 13-week academic semester, where each module (chapter) builds upon the previous one.

-   **Week 1-3: Module 1 – The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)**: Introduces foundational middleware, setting up the communication backbone for robots.
-   **Week 4-6: Module 2 – The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)**: Moves to simulating robots and environments, allowing for safe experimentation and data generation.
-   **Week 7-9: Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)**: Focuses on advanced perception, navigation, and learning, building intelligence on the simulated platform.
-   **Week 10-12: Module 4 – Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Explores the cutting-edge convergence of LLMs and robotics, enabling cognitive planning and intuitive interaction.
-   **Week 13: Appendices/Capstone Review**: Consolidates knowledge, provides advanced resources, and reviews a comprehensive project.

## Style Guardrails (Tone, Level, Examples, Pedagogy)

-   **Tone**: Professional, academic, encouraging, and clear. Avoid overly simplistic or overly jargon-filled language.
-   **Level**: Graduate/advanced undergraduate. Assumes a basic understanding of AI/robotics concepts but explains complex topics thoroughly.
-   **Examples**: Practical, concise, and directly illustrate the concepts. Prioritize real-world relevance or simplified analogous scenarios.
-   **Pedagogy**: "Learning by Doing" approach with clear explanations, step-by-step instructions, and hands-on exercises/projects. Emphasize problem-solving and critical thinking.

## Code Block Conventions (ROS 2, URDF, Gazebo, Isaac, VLA)

-   **Language Annotation**: Always specify the language (e.g., `python`, `xml`).
-   **Readability**: Use clear variable names, comments for complex logic, and consistent indentation (4 spaces).
-   **Focus**: Code snippets should be minimal, demonstrating specific concepts without unnecessary boilerplate.
-   **Placement**: Code blocks are embedded directly within relevant content sections, immediately following their introduction or explanation.
-   **Placeholder**: Explicitly state "Code Snippet Placeholder: [Description of code]" for content to be generated later.

## Reference Structure (APA)

-   All external references (academic papers, official documentation, key articles) will follow APA 7th edition citation style.
-   A dedicated "References" section will be included at the end of each module and a comprehensive list in the appendices.

## Docusaurus Layout Structure

-   **Root**: `docs/`
-   **Chapter Modules**: Each module will have its own subdirectory under `docs/` (e.g., `docs/module1-ros2/`, `docs/module2-digital-twin/`).
-   **`_category_.json`**: Each module subdirectory will contain a `_category_.json` for Docusaurus sidebar generation, including `label`, `position`, and potentially `collapsed` status.
-   **`intro.md`**: A general introduction file at `docs/intro.md` to set the stage for the book.
-   **Sidebars**: Autogenerated using Docusaurus's filesystem-based routing and `_category_.json` files.
-   **Version Control**: Docusaurus versioning features will be leveraged to manage different book editions (v1, v2, etc.), with clear documentation through Spec-Kit Plus.
