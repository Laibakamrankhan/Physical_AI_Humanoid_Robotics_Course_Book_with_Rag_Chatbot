# Implementation Plan: Embodied Intelligence: Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics Book Chapters

**Branch**: `1-physical-ai-robotics` | **Date**: 2025-12-04 | **Spec**: [specs/1-physical-ai-robotics/spec.md](specs/1-physical-ai-robotics/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/1-physical-ai-robotics/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

This plan outlines the architectural strategy for generating detailed chapter-level specifications for a book on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. The book will cover four main modules, ensuring compatibility with Claude Code, Spec-Kit Plus for automation and reproducibility, and Docusaurus for deployment to GitHub Pages. The approach emphasizes leveraging AI-native development workflows and a spec-driven creation process to ensure technical transparency and reusable intelligence.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown (for book content), JavaScript/TypeScript (for Docusaurus), Python (for Claude Code Agents/Skills). Specific versions will align with Docusaurus and Claude Code SDK recommendations.
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus, Node.js, npm/yarn, Git, Claude Code SDK, Spec-Kit Plus, Context 7 MCP for Docusaurus, GitHub MCP.
**Storage**: Local filesystem for Markdown files, Docusaurus static assets, and Spec-Kit Plus artifacts. Git repository for version control.
**Testing**: Docusaurus build/linting checks, Spec-Kit Plus schema validation for specs, content consistency checks, functional testing of generated content.
**Target Platform**: Web (Docusaurus output deployed to GitHub Pages).
**Project Type**: Documentation/Book Project (static site generation).
**Performance Goals**: Efficient Docusaurus build times, responsive content generation by Claude Code Agents, quick loading of static Docusaurus site.
**Constraints**: Chapters must be 1500–3000 words. Output format is Markdown. Inclusion of placeholders for diagrams, code snippets, tables, and figures. Strict adherence to academic clarity. Modular structure conforming to Spec-Kit Plus directory conventions. Minimum 8 chapters total. Appendices must contain specific AI artifact definitions.
**Scale/Scope**: Four core modules (chapters) forming the primary content, with additional chapters and appendices as per constitution. The entire book creation process will be AI-driven and reproducible.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- [x] **AI-Native Development Workflow**: The project leverages Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus as the primary intelligence and automation framework.
- [x] **Spec-Driven Creation**: Every chapter and artifact will follow a spec-first workflow using Spec-Kit Plus conventions.
- [x] **Unified Documentation Architecture**: The book will be structured and deployed using Docusaurus, ensuring consistent architecture, versioning, and automated deployment.
- [x] **Reusable Intelligence**: The plan incorporates the creation and application of reusable Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills.
- [x] **Technical Transparency**: All prompts, specs, subagent definitions, workflows, and tool configurations will be documented for reproducibility.
- [x] **Spec-Kit Plus Compliance**: All files will adhere to Spec-Kit Plus directory structure, naming conventions, schema validation, and pattern rules.
- [x] **Claude Code Requirements**: The project aims to meet the minimum requirements for custom Subagents and reusable Agent Skills as defined in the constitution.
- [x] **Docusaurus Standards**: The plan ensures the book will compile successfully, and the sidebar/nav structure will be autogenerated using specs. Version control (v1, v2, etc.) will be documented via Spec-Kit Plus.
- [x] **GitHub MCP Integration**: All commits, branches, and automations will utilize the GitHub MCP server.
- [x] **Context 7 MCP for Docusaurus**: This will be integrated and used for content generation, refactoring, and structure validation.
- [x] **Constraints (Length, Content Requirements, File Structure Compliance, Deployment)**: All project constraints, including chapter length, content details, file structure, and GitHub Pages deployment, are explicitly addressed and will be enforced.
- [x] **Success Criteria (Spec Accuracy, Claude Automation, MCP Pipelines Functioning, Consistency and Structure, Reusability Bonus, Documentation Quality, Verification)**: The plan is designed to meet all defined success criteria for the book project.

**Structure Decision**: The primary project structure will revolve around Docusaurus for documentation and Spec-Kit Plus for specification and automation. Custom Claude Code subagents and skills will reside in the `claude/` directory. The `docs/` directory will contain the book chapters and Docusaurus-specific content. This aligns with the unified documentation architecture and Spec-Kit Plus compliance principles.
